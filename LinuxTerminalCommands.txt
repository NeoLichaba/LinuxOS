Linux Terminal Commands
-------------------------

1. Why Master The Command Line

- More control over machine 
- Faster
- Automate many tasks
- Available everywhere
- Required
- Needed for cloud computing

2. World of OS

- Windows OS vs. UNIX OS
- Linux, Android, Chrome, Mac OS X - descendent of UNIX

3. Shells and Bash

- Terminal: Runs a shell
- Shell: Computer interface to an OS
	- Outer layer around OS
	- Takes commands and passes to OS to perform
	- Linux - bash; Mac - ZSH etc.
	- Bash - common


Linux Commands
-------------------------------
- pwd - print working directory
      - tells user of current working directory
- whoami - who am I?
- man - manual; informative;
      - man <command> - provides more information on the command
- q - quit command
- clear - clears all prev commands
	- clear -x 
	- ctrl + l (shortcut)
- Synopsis (in manual) - contains syntax/different options

List
------
- ls - list contents of current directory
- ls <name of file>/ - provide relative path (relative to location) and peek somewhere else
		     - only works if in the particular location 
- ls /home/neo/Documents/ - provide full absolute path to peek into a particular folder
- ls -l - long listing format
- ls -a - includes in your list, files that begin with a .

Change Directory
-------------------
- cd - change directory; no manual for cd; 
- cd <file name> - change directory to file name
- cd .. - parent directory (back 1 level)
- cd ../../ - change back multiple levels
- cd </home/neo/Documents/> - change to folder giving absolute path
- cd ~/Desktop/ - change directory to home

Folder Structure
---------------------
- / - root folder
- /home directory - houses Desktop, Documents folder etc.

~ - home directory

Creating files/folders
-------------------------------
- mkdir - make directory
- mkdir -p <file names> - make nested folders
- touch - creates files
	- mostly uses text editor
	- if file already exists, opens the file in write mode and timestamp of the file is updated

Removing files
-------------------------------
- rmdir <filename/> - remove directory; works if folder is empty 
- rm -r <filename/> - remove (recursive) directory (with content)
- rm -ri <filename/> - descends into file and actively decide what to keep 
- rm <filename> - removes files/directories; unable to locate folder thus be careful when doing so
- rm -v - remove verbose; lists output of what was deleted
- rm -rv 

- open <filename> - open
- open <directory name> - open
- mv -v - move (verbose) file; specify current path and its new path; last path = destination folder
        - how you rename files and folders
